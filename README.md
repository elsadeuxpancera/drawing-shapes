Here is what you should record in your notes:

-   Record at least one time when your program\'s behavior differed from what you wanted it to do.

    -   What are the differences between the actual and desired behavior?

    -   What is your process for figuring out the problem with your code?

    -   What is the solution to this bug? That is, what do you need to fix about your code to make it have the desired behavior?

-   Record at least one time when your program didn\'t compile.

    -   What compilation errors did you get?
 Shapes.java:7: error: cannot find symbol
             t.turn(90);
              ^
      symbol:   method turn(int)
      location: variable t of type Turtle

    -   What is your process for figuring out the problem with your code? Describe the resources or strategies you used in this process.

    -   What is the solution to the bug? That is, what do you need to fix about your code to make it compile?
